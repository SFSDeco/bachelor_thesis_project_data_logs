# Bachelor Thesis Project Data & Logs
This repository contains the data files referenced in the Bachelor Thesis "Evaluating Direct Prompt Injection Counter-measures in API-Integrated LLMs Using Ad-versarial Prompt Generation" written by David Ung for his Bachelor Thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien. It contains the full contents of all evaluated data which can be further replicated by the logs included.

### Benign Results
Contains the logs of benign prompts which were sent into the program as a sanity check.

### Test-Result-Logs.zip
This Zip contains all Logs generated by the experiment runs. Each Log is carefully sorted according to the Taxonomy created in the Thesis and then further distinguished by the countermeasure employed during the experiment. While not actively used to extract the data, the logs can be used to recreate the data in the excel file.

### Results_Excel_Files.zip
This Zip contains the two Excel Spreadsheets where the Experiment Data was collected in APG_Countermeasure_Text_Data.xlsx contains the normal Experiment results (~1700+ data rows) and two Pivot Tables for the calculation of derived Metrics (ESR, AESR roughly corresponding to ASR@30; GASR, AGASR roughly comparable to ASR@10). Meanwhile benignpropmt_result.xlsx contains the data collected from the benign prompt runs (Sanity Check).

Should the acquisition of said files not be possible, the author may also provide access to a Zip containing all three on Request.
